the node it's itended run out side brewser run directly on computer


### benifet of node

* the node it's come to solve many of problems in wep like real time application and it's desiged to  optimiz throughput in web

* the code is written by plain old javascript that mean less time neede to dealing with "context shift" between languages 

* javascript relative new programming language and benefits from improvement in other languages 

* the node package maneger (npm) it's acsses to hundreds of 
thousands of reusable packages

* the nods its available on Microsoft windows , mac , and many of systems, it's supported by many web hosting providers, that often provided specific features for hosting node site

* it has a very big ecosystem and many people willing to help

## NPM 
the largest software registry and it's the open sores it's allows to developers share and install packages . many of organizations use npm to manage private development

## npm contan three componants

* websie :
Use the website to discover packages, set up profiles, and manage other aspects of your npm experience. For example, you can set up organizations to manage access to public or private packages.

* CLI : 
run form the terminal that makes the develpvers maor interacte with npm

* registry :
is a larger database of javascript 

## Use npm to 

* download standalone tools you can use right away.

* Run packages without downloading using npx.

* Share code with any npm user, anywhere.

* Restrict code to specific developers.


* Create organizations to coordinate package maintenance, coding,   and developers.

* Form virtual teams by using organizations.

* Manage multiple versions of code and code dependencies.

* Update applications easily when underlying code is updated.

* Discover multiple ways to solve the same puzzle.

* Find other developers who are working on similar problems and projects.

## TDD
test driven development refers to a style of programming in which three activities are tightly coding, testing  and design

## Benefits
* many teams report significant reductions in defect rates, at the cost of a moderate increase in initial development effort

* the same teams tend to report that these overheads are more than offset by a reduction in effort in projects’ final phases

# Cl/CD

Continuous integration, or CI, is a workflow strategy that helps ensure

everyone’s changes will integrate with the current version of the project.

This lets you catch bugs, reduce merge conflicts, and have confidence your software is working. While the details may vary depending on your development environment, most CI systems feature the same basic tools and processes. In most scenarios, a team will practice CI in conjunction with automated testing using a dedicated server or CI service.

# SQL vs NOSQL

## *SQL*  ( structured query language )

- Sql is called a relational database

- Sql database table base

- defining and manipulating of data which is powerful

- Good for fit complex query 

- SQL databases are not the best fit for hierarchical data storage

- 

### ***Eamples***

SQL database examples: `MySql`, `Oracle`, `Sqlite`, `Postgres` and `MS-SQL`. 

### ***Scalability***

- the SQL databases are vertically scalable you can scalable by increasing the CPU and RAN SSD on a single server

### ***For high transational***

- the SQL database it's best for fit heavy transactional applications and it's more stable

## *NOSQL*

- Nosql is called a non-relational database or distributed database.

- Nosql databases are document-based, key-value pairs, graph databases, or wide-column stores.  

- NOSql focused query on a collection of documents.

- not good for fit complex query  

- NoSQL database fits better for the vertically data storage

- 

### ***Eamples***

`MongoDB`, `BigTable`, `Redis`, `RavenDb`, `Cassandra`,`Hbase`, `Neo4j `and `CouchDb`.

### ***Scalability***

- the NOSQL database is hierarchical you can add a few more servers  

 ### ***For high transational***

 - you can use it for transactional but still is it not stable

# Context API Behaviors

## Globally Accessible
The state of our snackbars (which ones are visible) can be localized to a single centralized component. That same centralized component can be responsible for rendering them. There’s really no need for another component somewhere in the tree to hook into that state (at least not in our use-case).

However, the management of that state (adding, removing) needs to be globally accessible.

Context can let us do just this.

```
export const SnackBarContext = createContext()

export function SnackBarProvider({ children }) {
  const [alerts, setAlerts] = useState([])

  return (
    <SnackBarContext.Provider value={{ setAlerts }}>
      {children}
      {alerts.map((alert) => <SnackBar key={alert}>{alert}</SnackBar>)}
    </SnackBarContext.Provider>
  )
}
```

Our context provider is now responsible for both displaying the local state of the snackbars (we call them alerts), and for exposing an API for globally managing them.

The other half of the puzzle is we now need a consumer for this provider. It turns out that our custom hook from before is nothing more than a small wrapper around the useContext internal React hook, which consumes our new context.

```
import { useContext } from 'react'

import { SnackBarContext } from 'components/snack-bar-provider'

const useSnackBars = () => useContext(SnackBarContext)

export default useSnackBars

```

## Higher Level API & Behaviour

```
export const SnackBarContext = createContext()

const AUTO_DISMISS = 5000

export function SnackBarProvider({ children }) {
  const [alerts, setAlerts] = useState([])
  
  const activeAlertIds = alerts.join(',')
  useEffect(() => {
    if (activeAlertIds.length > 0) {
      const timer = setTimeout(() => setAlerts((alerts) => alerts.slice(0, alerts.length - 1)), AUTO_DISMISS)
      return () => clearTimeout(timer)
    }
  }, [activeAlertIds])

  const addAlert = (alert) => setAlerts((alerts) => [alert, ...alerts])

  const value = { addAlert }
    
  return (
    <SnackBarContext.Provider value={value}>
      {children}
      {alerts.map((alert) => <SnackBar key={alert}>{alert}</SnackBar>)}
    </SnackBarContext.Provider>
  )
}

```

## Room for Change
There’s a lot of buzz around how you can replace a lot of what Redux does with useContext and useReducer. The combination of these two hooks means we can have a global state and use Redux-like reducers, actions, and dispatchers to mutate that global state. To an extent, it’s possible.

It’s worth thinking about this if you have multiple ways to mutate the state and/or your state is complicated and/or dependant on one another. In our case we don’t have either of those problems. So you could do that. But I won’t.
